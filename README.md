## üöÄ Setup Instructions

**0. Prerequisites**

- [ ] Ensure you have Node.js version 16 or higher installed.
- [ ] Create a a Mapbox [access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/)
- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the root repository and add the required variables:

```
NX_DATABASE_STORAGE=builtrix_development.sqlite
NX_REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=[YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN]
```

**1. Clone the repository**

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```
npm install
```

**3. Start the development server**

```
npx nx serve server
```

**4. Seed the database**

After you start the server, a `builtrix_development.sqlite` file will be generated in the root directory of the repository. To populate this SQLite database with data (a process known as "seeding"), follow these steps:

1. Download and install [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
2. Open DB Browser and click on "Open Database".
3. Navigate to the root directory of the repository and select the `builtrix_development.sqlite` file.
4. Go to File > Import > Table from CSV file.
   <br/>
   Note: The order of importing data is important. Start with the **metadata** table, followed by the **smart_meter** table, and finally the **energy_source_breakdown** table.

If you encounter any issues with these steps, first verify that the `builtrix_development.sqlite` file exists in the root directory and that its name matches the `NX_DATABASE_STORAGE` value in your `.env` file. If the problem persists, please contact me. I can provide a pre-populated database file that you can simply replace in the root directory.

**5. Start the client**

```
npx nx serve client
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Nx Monorepo** for its streamlined monorepo management, facilitating efficient code sharing and scalable architecture.
- **Typescript** for enhancing code reliability and developer productivity.
- **Sqlite** for its simplicity and ease of setup for development purposes.
- **Material UI** for its easy-to-customize components, which speed up UI development and keep the design consistent.
- **Mapbox** for providing interactive maps and location features as suggested.
- **Mui Charts** for creating consistent, easy-to-use charts, leveraging the existing use of Material-UI in the project.

## üéØ Objectives

- [x] Building clickable geo-location on map
- [x] Aggregated data of energy consumption
- [ ] Energy Source Breakdown (pie chart): _Couldn't reach the development on time_
- [ ] Implement a simple authentication system: _Couldn't reach the development on time but I could share previous projects in which I implemented authentications systems_
- [x] Filter
- [x] Hover for metadata

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Complete the required development
- [ ] Add selected building to the url to make the selection sharable
- [ ] Better implement queries to save the filter data from the selected buildings
- [ ] Error handling
